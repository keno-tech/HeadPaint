# Ticket-1: Project Initialization & CI Setup

## Description
Initialize the HeadPaint iOS application repository. This includes setting up the Xcode project structure, configuring version control (Git), and establishing a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline using GitHub Actions to ensure code quality and build stability from day one.

## Implementation Steps
1. [ ] **Repository Setup**: Initialize Git and configured `.gitignore` for Swift/Xcode.
2. [ ] **Xcode Project**: Create a new SwiftUI project named `HeadPaint` (iOS).
3. [ ] **Directory Structure**: Organize project files, ensuring `GEMINI.md` remains at the root.
4. [ ] **CI Pipeline**: Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to build the app and run tests on every push to `main` and PRs.
5. [ ] **Verification**: Verify the CI pipeline runs successfully on a test branch/commit.
